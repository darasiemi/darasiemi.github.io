### Autumn 2024 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 

**Institution:** University College Dublin

**Course Description:** By the end of this module, students will be able to explain key AI principles and evaluate their strengths and limitations. They will implement search algorithms, apply adversarial game-playing techniques, and compare optimization methods like Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Students will also explore AI Planning, represent problems effectively, and apply planning algorithms. They will differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning techniques such as Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes, kNN, and K-Means, and understand Neural Networks, especially in Computer Vision. Additionally, students are expected to demonstrate independent research beyond the lecture material.
