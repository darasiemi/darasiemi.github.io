Hi, welcome to my profile page! You can call me Dara.

I am a PhD student at University College Dublin, in the School of Computer Science under the [ML-Labs](https://www.ml-labs.ie/). My PhD is also jointly sponsored by [Health Rhythms](https://www.healthrhythms.com/), a data science and mental health company. I am being supervised by [Dr. Mark Matthews](https://people.ucd.ie/mark.matthews)

My research focuses on assessing mental health of a mental health population (people with bipolar disorder), through their financial behaviour using objective financial data. My research interest is in machine learning applications.

If you are interested in what I go, and you want to connect, you can reach me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwadara-adedeji-183770106/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_darasimii).
