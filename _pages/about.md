Hi, welcome to my profile page! You can call me Dara.

I am a Ph.D. student at the University College Dublin, in the School of Computer Science under the [ML-Labs](https://www.ml-labs.ie/). My PhD is also jointly sponsored by [Health Rhythms](https://www.healthrhythms.com/), a data science and mental health company. I am being supervised by [Mark Matthews, PhD](https://people.ucd.ie/mark.matthews).

My research focuses on assessing the mental health of people with bipolar disorder using objective financial data, statistical analysis, privacy-preserving machine learning and public engaging participatory studies. My research also cuts across data instrumentation and collection for efficient modelling.
