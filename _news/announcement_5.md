I am happy to have completed the MLOps zoomcamp by Data Talks
Club, and finishing in the [top 15](https://courses.datatalks.club/mlops-zoomcamp-2024/leaderboard) out of more than 1000 enrolled participants worldwide. My final project which is on stress prediction using multimodal inputs can be found [here](https://github.com/darasiemi/mental_health_mlops_project).
